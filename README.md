<p>This Project uses transfer learning to build a CNN model to classify whether a patient have brain tumor or not based on MRI scan.</P>

*Data*
=======
<p>This Project uses transfer learning to build a CNN model to classify whether a patient have brain tumor or not based on MRI scan using tensorflows.</p>

**About the Data**
<p>The dataset is in Brain_tumor dataset folder. This folder have 2 subfolder yes and no containing 253 MRI scan images. Folder yes have 155 tumrous MRI scaned images and folder no have 98 non-tumorous MRI scanned images.</p>

## Data Augmentation
<p>As the dataset size was small ,data augmentation was done to increase the size of data and also to decrease skewness of data.<br>
 **Before augmentation:**<br>
  155 positive examples and 98 negative examples.<br>
 From data augmentation 1 positive example is converted into 7 and 1 positive example ois converted into 10 so <br>
  **After augmentation:**
  1085 positive and 980 negative exapmples.<br>
  Augmented data is saved in folder augmented_data.
