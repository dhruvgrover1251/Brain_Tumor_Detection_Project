# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Project

<p>This Project uses transfer learning to build a CNN model to classify whether a patient have brain tumor or not based on MRI scan.</P>

**About the Data**
<p>The dataset is in Brain_tumor dataset folder. This folder have 2 subfolder yes and no containing 253 MRI scan images. Folder yes have 155 tumrous MRI scaned images and folder no have 98 non-tumorous MRI scanned images.</p>

## Data Augmentation

<p>As the dataset size was small ,data augmentation was done to increase the size of data and also to decrease skewness of data.<br>
  
**Before augmentation:**<br>

 155 positive examples and 98 negative examples.<br>
 From data augmentation 1 positive example is converted into 7 and 1 positive example ois converted into 10 so <br>
 
  **After augmentation:**<br>
  
  1085 positive and 980 negative exapmples.<br>
  Augmented data is saved in folder augmented_data.
  
  ## Data Preprocessing
  
  For every image following process is applied.
  1. Crop the brain through opencv(finding contours).
  2. Resizing all images into a common size to fir to neural network.
  3. Applying normalization.
  4. Appending images pixels to X(feauture vector) and giving them labels(y).
  5. Shuffling X and Y.
  
  ## Transfer Learning
  
  1. **VGG16**<br>
     This model was applied with same wieghts as learned from imagenet dataset. Last 3 layers of VGG16 were removed and trainable  layers were inserted.

 ## Trying own model 
 This model was tried in expectation that less number of parameters may have greater accuracy but did not perform as good as above models.<br>

   # Notes
   1. Notebooks in the repository are made in google colab.
   2.All the models with increasing validation accuracy are available in the folder with their name.
